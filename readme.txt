How I ran these:

I opened up a cmd shell (or you can use Mac Terminal):

Then navigate to the folder do for each one type:

python main.py < test1.txt > out1.txt
python main.py < test2.txt > out2.txt
python main.py < test3.txt > out3.txt
python main.py < test4.txt > out4.txt

Note that your main program needs to be main.py.  Some of you named it other things.  I renamed program main program so I could run my scripts.  You could do the same.
